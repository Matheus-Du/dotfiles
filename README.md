# Dotfiles

Collection of dotfiles I use for config on my local machine. I use [GNU stow](https://www.gnu.org/software/stow/manual/stow.html) to create symlinks for each dotfile. To setup, you should just be able to navigate to `~/dotfiles` (this repo) & run `stow <config option>` (e.g. `stow nvim`) to create a symlink between the two config files.
